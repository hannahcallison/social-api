# Social Network API

## Introduction 
For this project we created a social network API using MongoDB. By using the packages listed below users can create thought posts, add to their friends list, and react to friends thoughts, like a working social network. 

## Disclaimer
We worked on a mini project in class that heavily influenced the work in this homework. There were also several activities that influenced the work here. If you have any plagirism concerns please reach out to me and I can direct you to my instructor who can vouch for this claim. 

## Installation
User steps in terminal:

>npm i, to download the necessary packages

>npm run start, to begin listening on the localhost

>Open Insomnia and place get/post/put/delete requests. 

>Use correct routes to interact with the API
